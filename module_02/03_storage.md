# ‚òÅÔ∏è Module 02: Storage

## üî∏ Overview

Scalable, durable, and secure storage services in Azure. Optimized for different data types and redundancy.

## üì¶ Redundancy

- In the **primary region**: data is always replicated three times
  - LRS
  - ZRS
- In the **secondary region**: based on region-pairs, and it can't be changed
  - GRS
  - GZRS

Data in the **secondary region** may not be up-to-date due to RPO (usually 15 mins).

## üóÉÔ∏è Storage Types

### Azure Blobs

Storage for unstructured data; such as text, images or binary files.
